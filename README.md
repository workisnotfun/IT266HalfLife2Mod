=================

Final Project
Force Weapon must be equipped to use any of the force abilities.

The button #Mod_Force must be bound to 'x' (only needs to be done for the first time).

Forcepower must be charged before using any force abilities by holding 'x' at any time. (It's a good idea to hold 'x' as long and often as you can).

You can force leap with the jump button (space bar) and keep jumping until force power runs out.  

For Force push you left click,
For Force pull you right click,
For Force lift you look up after pulling something,
For Force throw left click after pulling something.
